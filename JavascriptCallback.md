# `JavascriptCallback` object #

You can pass a callback function from Javascript to Python, when you do that, what you get in Python is a `JavascriptCallback` object that you can use to call javascript function back.

If you call the javascript callback and it fails, instead of js exception what you get is a python exception that exits the application by default (see sys.excepthook in examples), if you want to know more read about [Javascript Errors](JavascriptErrors.md).

See also [JavascriptBindings](JavascriptBindings.md).
