## CEF 3 ##

CEF 3 supports WebM & Ogg Theora video codecs. MPEG-4 & H.264
are proprietary codecs and are not included in Chromium builds,
as there are licensing issues:

> Codecs like MP3 and AAC are included in Google Chrome releases but
> not Chromium builds. This is because these formats are not open and
> require licensing. Distributing these codecs with your application
> without a licensing agreement may violate the law in certain countries.
> You should discuss with a lawyer if appropriate.
