  * Added functions [cefpython](cefpython.md).`GetAppSetting()` / `GetCommandLineSwitch()`

Version 31.2 released on January 10, 2015.
  * Initial release of Windows 64bit binaries ([Issue 82](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=82))

Version 31.1 released on December 4, 2014.
  * (Windows) When cefpython detects that application is DPI aware (may be enabled by user in .exe properties) then it will set ApplicationSettings."auto\_zooming" to "system\_dpi" automatically. Added the DpiAware.`IsProcessDpiAware` method. See revision c11190523824.
  * Added new callbacks to LifespanHandler: `_OnAfterCreated`, `RunModal`, `DoClose`, `OnBeforeClose`. Thanks to Simon Hatt for the patch ([Issue 139](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=139)).

  * Improvements to Linux installers (debian package, setup.py). See [Issue 149](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=149), [Issue 147](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=147), [Issue 145](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=145), [Issue 105](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=105), [Issue 99](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=99).

  * Added GTK example on Linux ([Issue 95](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=95))
  * Added High DPI support on Windows. See the DpiAware wiki page and the ApplicationSettings.`auto_zooming` option. Example usage is in the wxpython.py example. See [Issue 112](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=112), [Issue 128](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=128).
  * Added Developer Tools support. See [Browser](Browser.md).`ShowDevTools`. Can be launched from mouse context menu as well. See also ApplicationSettings.`remote_debugging_port`, a default value of 0 enables devtools, to disable set it to -1. ([Issue 81](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=81))
  * Mouse context menu is now configurable, see ApplicationSettings.`context_menu`. New menu items added: "Reload", "Open in external browser", "Developer Tools". ([Issue 122](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=122))
  * Implemented a default DownloadHandler. File downloads are handled automatically with no additional code required. Added new option ApplicationSettings.`downloads_enabled`. ([Issue 87](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=87))
  * Exposed API for execution of tasks on various threads. This fixes problems with keyboard in popups in the wxpython.py example on Windows, an example usage is there. See [cefpython](cefpython.md).`PostTask`. See [Issue 61](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=61), [Issue 80](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=80).
  * Fixed issues with embedding multiple browsers in tabs ([Issue 97](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=97))

  * Fixed the browser cleanup code in the `OnClose` event in the wxpython examples, it could possibly cause crashes during shutdown ([Issue 107](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=107))
  * Fixed a crash in V8 javascript bindings when a call to [Frame](Frame.md).`LoadUrl` changed origin (scheme + domain). For example when a redirect to a different domain was being made. This problem occured only when javascript bindings were set ([Issue 130](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=130)).
  * Enabled caching on HTTPS even when there is certificate error, but only when ApplicationSettings.`ignore_certificate_errors` is set to True ([Issue 125](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=125))
  * Disabled tcmalloc hook on Linux in the CEF Python official binaries. It caused crashes when cefpython was not the very first library being imported ([Issue 73](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=73)).

  * Moved LoadHandler.`OnRendererProcessTerminated` and `OnPluginCrashed` to RequestHandler (does not affect code)

  * Added new option ApplicationSettings.background\_color

Version 29.4 released on January 15, 2014.
  * Added `commandLineSwitches` param to [cefpython](cefpython.md).Initialize(). See the [CommandLineSwitches](CommandLineSwitches.md) wiki page. Thanks to Finn Hughes for the patch. See [Issue 65](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=65).
