## Introduction ##

CEF Python is an open source project founded by [Czarek Tomczak](http://www.linkedin.com/in/czarektomczak) in 2012 to provide python bindings for the [Chromium Embedded Framework](http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/). See the growing list of [applications using CEF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework#Applications_using_CEF) on wikipedia. Examples of embedding CEF browser are available for many popular GUI toolkits including: [wxPython](wxPython.md), [PyGTK](PyGTK.md), [PyQt](PyQt.md), [PySide](PySide.md), [Kivy](Kivy.md), [Panda3D](Panda3D.md) and [PyWin32](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/source/browse/cefpython/cef3/windows/binaries_32bit/pywin32.py).

Some use cases for CEF:
  * Embed a web browser control with great HTML5 support (based on Chromium)
  * Use it to create a HTML5 based GUI in an application. This can act as a replacement for GUI toolkits like wxWidgets/Qt/Gtk. For native communication between javascript and python use [javascript bindings](JavascriptBindings.md). Another option is to run an internal python web server and use websockets/XMLHttpRequest for js<>python communication. This way you can write a desktop app in the same way you write web apps.
  * Render web content off-screen in applications that use custom drawing frameworks. See the [Kivy](Kivy.md) and [Panda3D](Panda3D.md) examples.
  * Use it for automated testing of existing web applications. Use it for web scraping, or as a web crawler or other kind of internet bots.

## Supported Python versions and platforms ##

  * Supported Python versions: 2.7 (Python 3.4 will be supported soon, see [Issue 121](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/issues/detail?id=121))
  * Supported platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac (both 32bit and 64bit binaries are available for all platforms)

## Built a cool app? ##

Built a cool app using CEF Python and would like to share info with the community? Talk about it on the [CEF Python Forum](https://groups.google.com/group/cefpython?hl=en).

## Familiar with PHP or Go? ##

The author of CEF Python is also working on CEF bindings for other languages such as PHP and Go. For PHP take a look at the [PHP Desktop](http://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop/) project. For Go see the [CEF2go](https://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go) project on GitHub.
