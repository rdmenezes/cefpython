# Browser settings #



## Introduction ##

These settings can be passed to [cefpython](cefpython.md).`CreateBrowser()`.

In some cases, the default values of settings that are suggested by its name may not always be correct. This is because in one of CEF releases naming of these settings changed, and they started to accept states (enabled or disabled), instead of the state being included in its name (some\_option\_disabled). Cefpython tries to be backwards compatible, that's why the old naming convention is still used. Read description of setting and if you see that it mentions command line switch that starts with "disable-", it means that its default state is "enabled". If the command line switch starts with "enable-" then its default state is "disabled".

## Settings ##

> used. Note that accelerated compositing requires hardware support and may
> not work on all systems even when enabled. Also configurable using the
> "disable-accelerated-compositing" [command-line switch](CommandLineSwitches.md).

### accelerated\_compositing\_enabled (bool) ###

> Available only in CEF 1.

> Set to true (1) to enable accelerated compositing. This is turned off by default because the current in-process GPU implementation does not support it correctly.
